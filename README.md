# Phishing and Scam Detection on Social Media

This project focuses on detecting phishing and scam content shared on social media platforms by combining machine learning techniques with external threat intelligence validation. A Flask-based security dashboard is developed to visualize and analyze suspicious URLs and content.

## Project Overview
Phishing attacks and fraudulent links are among the most common cyber threats on social media. This project applies a two-stage detection mechanism: (1) Machine Learning-based classification and (2) VirusTotal API validation to improve detection reliability.

## Technologies Used
Python, Flask, MongoDB, Random Forest, VirusTotal API, HTML, CSS, pandas, scikit-learn, WHOIS-based risk analysis.

## Methodology
URL preprocessing and normalization, feature extraction, WHOIS-based domain risk analysis, Random Forest classification for phishing detection, VirusTotal API validation for suspicious URLs, and visualization through a Flask-based security dashboard.

## Key Features
Two-layer phishing detection mechanism, integration with real-world threat intelligence, web-based security monitoring dashboard, and security-focused design.

## Installation and Usage
Clone the repository, install dependencies, set your VirusTotal API key as an environment variable, and run the Flask application locally to access the dashboard.

## Future Improvements
Deep learning-based phishing detection, real-time URL scanning, social media platform API integration, and advanced visualization and reporting features.
